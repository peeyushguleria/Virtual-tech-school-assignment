        <div class="box" id="title2">Why We
            Started It?</div>
        <div class="box" id="paragraph2" style="font-size: 20px;">Our mentor, Apoorv Goyal, embarked on an year long journey while learning how to code. Passionate about education, he explored the most remote and unexplored extensions of our education system and found out many flaws in it. He identified the difference in education amongst the privileged and the underprivileged folks, how vastly it differs and how bad the situation is that most of the people are unaware of. Being a college dropout, Apoorv realizes that degree is just a piece of paper and the real thing that matters are the skills. Hoping to build a community that focuses more on the skills than the merits, he start Virtual Tech School where he aims to reduce the gap in the quality of education among the privileged and the underprivileged.</div>
